Most of my solutions follow from this theorem:

1. Generate a free category from:

                   Graph     Category

(a) A graph                   ┌─────┐
w/ 1 node                     │     │id
and 0 edges           G       └🠖 G ─┘


(b) A graph
w/ 1 node          ┌─────┐    ┌─────┐
and 1              │     │    │     │id
directed           └🠖 G ─┘    └🠖 G ─┘
edge

(c) A graph                    ┌───┐
w/ 2 nodes            A        ↳ A ┘idₐ
and a single          🠗          🠗
arrow between         B        ↱ B ┐
them                           └───┘idᵇ

(d) A graph      ↱↱↱↱ G ┬┐┐┐ ↱↱↱↱↱ G ┬┐┐┐┐
w/ a single      │││└ a ┘│││ ││││└ a ┘││││
node and 26      ││└─ b ─┘││ │││└─ b ─┘│││
arrows marked    │└─ ... ─┘│ ││└─ ... ─┘││
w/ the letters   └─── z ───┘ │└─── z ───┘│
of the alphabet              └──── id ───┘


2. What kind of order is this?

(a) A set of sets with the inclusion relation: A is included in B if every
    element of A is also an element of B.

    TBD

(b) C++ types with the following subtyping relation: T1 is a subtype of T2 if a
    pointer to T1 can be passed to a function that expects a pointer to T2
    without triggering a compilation error.

    TBD


3. Considering that Bool is a set of two values True and False, show that it
   forms two (set-theoretical) monoids with respect to, respectively, operator
   && (AND) and || (OR).

                           &&                            ||

IDENTITY        True  &&  _     == True       False  ||  _      == False
                _     &&  True  == True       _      ||  False  == False

                    a  &&  b  &&  c               a  ||  b  ||  c
ASSOCIATIVITY   == (a  &&  b) &&  c           == (a  ||  b) ||  c
                ==  a  && (b  &&  c)          ==  a  || (b  ||  c)


4. Represent the Bool monoid with the AND operator as a category: List the
   morphisms and their rules of composition.

AND False && AND False = AND False
AND False && AND True  = AND False
AND True  && AND False = AND False
AND True  && AND True  = AND True


5. Represent addition modulo 3 as a monoid category.

    TBD
